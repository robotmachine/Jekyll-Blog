Many years ago back when i was in university, i used to live with these two guys: Chad was working in a brew-your-own-beer establishment and Eric was a slacker who was staying on our couch for an extended period of time.  
  
Chad had a little ritual when he got up for work every morning. After washing up, he would grab a seat right beside our sleeping guest in the livingroom. He would spend the next half an hour drinking coffee, brewing himself bottle tokes and whispering into Eric's ear over and over and over:  
  
"Kill the mayor. Kill the mayor, Eric. Eric, kill the mayor. Eric! Kill the mayor!"  
  
This continued for a period of months until one day Eric and I were walking home from a trip downtown. Passing in front of City Hall, Eric suddenly came to a stop with a perplexed look on his face.  
  
"Eric, what's wrong?" I asked.  
  
"I don't know" he replied. "Something about the mayor"
