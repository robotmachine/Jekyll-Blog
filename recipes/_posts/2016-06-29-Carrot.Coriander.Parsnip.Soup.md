# Carrot, Coriander, and Parsnip Soup
Servings: 5  
  
## Ingredients
* 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 8 large carrots, peeled and sliced
* 2 parsnips, peeled and sliced
* 4 shallots, minced
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp sea salt
* black pepper
* 4 cups chicken stock
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1/4 cup cilantro, finely chopped

## Method
Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan with lid. Add carrots, parsnips, shallots, coriander, salt, and a pinch of pepper to the pot. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low, and sauté until tender; about 10 minutes.  
Add the stock and milk, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil.  
Stir, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.  
Working in batches, carefully transfer to a blender (do not fill more than halfway). Remove center spout from lid to prevent it from bursting. Place lid on the blender, and hold a kitchen towel over the centre hole. Purée until smooth. Pour the soup back into the saucepan and heat over low until warm. Taste and adjust seasonings. Garnish with cilantro.
