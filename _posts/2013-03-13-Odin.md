My son's name is Odin. We normally use the Old Norse spelling of &#211;&#240;inn.  
When we say his name, though, we just say Odin (_Oh-den_), but a lot of people ask about the Norse spelling.  
&#211; is said the same as if you were to exclaim _Oh!_.  
&#208;&#240; is called [eth][eth-wiki] and is said _th_ as in fa _th_ er.  
Putting it all together, you would say &#211;&#240;inn as _Oh-then_.  
You can hear a computer say it [on Google Translate][gt-odin].
