Ever since I made the choice to move my family from Oregon to South Carolina I have spent a great amount of time thinking about my relationship with the south. I have noticed that most people I know who moved to the west coast from the south have the attitude of having "gotten out" or "escaped". I, too, had the same attitude when I arrived in California. What had I escaped from? I was a vegetarian for about five years and after I went back to eating meat I (half-jokingly) referred to myself as a 'recovering vegetarian'. Did I also see myself as a 'recovering southerner'?
